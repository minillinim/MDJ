MDJ - Mike's daft jukebox.

Implements a pretty basic jukebox script for XBMC. 

Please Note: This is not a finished project. It's been developed to work at a few friends weddings so some of the features are somewhat hard coded. YMMV... :)

First, find out where the addons should be installed to. On windows this should be C:\Program Files\XBMC\addons, on linux try ~/.xbmc/addons

In there, there should be a folder called script.MDJ and within that, a file called MDJ.py. open this file

There are only three things you need to look at and they are all in this section:

        #
        # Some global variables
        #
        self.musicRoot = '/home/uqmimelf/LEISURE/MUSIC/'    # Point this at the root of your party music
        self.queueMax = 8                                   # No more than this many in the queue
        self.bgimg = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'images','skin.png') # Location of the background image
       

1. Change the Music root.

     You should have a directory structure like: (on windows)

   C:\stuff\blah\blah\WEDDING_MUSIC
                                 PLAYLIST_1
                                        song1.mp3
                                        song2.mp3
                                        song3.mp3
                                        song4.mp3
                                 PLAYLIST_2
                                        song1.mp3
                                        song2.mp3
                                        song3.mp3
                                        song4.mp3

Then your music root should look like:

self.musicRoot = 'C:\stuff\blah\blah\WEDDING_MUSIC'

When you start MDJ you'll get a choice of PLAYLIST_1, PLAYLIST_2 etc...

2. update queue max. No larger than 15. 15 is what was at marnines, erica reckons it should be less, more than 15 and the queue won;t fit on the screen.

3. You can modify skin.png in paint or whatever. it's just an image which is splashed onto the background. The one provided is just for an example. May I recommend colorbrewer2.org if you are trying to choose non-clashing colours.

Once you have set it up, go from the front page of XBMC -> programs and MDJ should just be there. Use your mouse to choose songs, use escape on the keyboard to exit.
You will need to disable the screensaver in both XBMC and Windows and hide the keyboard on the night. Once you're in MDJ, no one can skip, no one can touch the volume. Use Escape to exit MDJ and then go back in to restart with a new playlist. It may sometimes crash XBMC when you exit / reenter but I haven't seen it crash during playback.
