MDJ - Mike's daft jukebox.

Implements a pretty basic jukebox script for XBMC. 

Please Note: This is not a finished project. It's been developed to work at a few friends weddings and it seems to work well enough.

Tested on EDEN.

First, you'll need to update some settings for the plugin. Most importantly, the music root. For this plug in to work correctly you should have a directory structure like: (on windows)

    C:
        stuff
            blah
                blah
                    WEDDING_MUSIC
                        PLAYLIST_1
                            song1.mp3
                            song2.mp3
                            song3.mp3
                            song4.mp3
                            ...
                        PLAYLIST_2
                            song1.mp3
                            song2.mp3
                            song3.mp3
                            song4.mp3
                            ...
                        ...


So I'm assuming that you've selected a set of party songs for th night and you've arranged them in folders according to
different "playlists"

If so, your music root should be set to: 'C:\stuff\blah\blah\WEDDING_MUSIC'

When you start MDJ you'll get a choice of PLAYLIST_1, PLAYLIST_2 etc... and the the songs will load under that. 

By default, the queue max is set to 15 songs, you can chancge this in the settings too. 15 is is a good amount I think, more than 15 and the queue might not fit on the screen properly.

Finally, you can modify skin.png in paint or whatever. It's just an image which is splashed onto the background. The one provided is just for an example. May I recommend colorbrewer2.org if you are trying to choose non-clashing colours.
The png file can be found in the images directory of this scripts folder.

Once you have set it up, go from the front page of XBMC -> programs and MDJ should just be there. Use your mouse to choose songs, use escape on the keyboard to exit.

NOTE: You will need to disable the screensaver in both XBMC and Windows and hide the keyboard on the night. Once you're in MDJ, no one can skip, no one can touch the volume. Use Escape to exit MDJ and then go back in to restart with a new playlist.

It may sometimes crash XBMC when you exit / reenter but I haven't seen it crash during playback.
